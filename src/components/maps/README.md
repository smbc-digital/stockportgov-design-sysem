# Stockport maps

The mapping solution Stockport Council uses is [LeafletJs](https://leafletjs.com/) an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

As Leaflet supplies it's own CSS naming structure with the maps we have overidden these styles within our own CSS, this means that these scss files do not follow the BEM naming structure suggested in the GOV.UK design system.
